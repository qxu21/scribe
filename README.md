# scribe

Scribe is a Discord bot that transcribes messages on command.

## Basic Usage

Use `!pin <first few words of message>` to pin a single message.

```
!quote
<first few words of start message>
<first few words of end message>
```

pins a message block.

The bot also accepts message IDs. You can copy any message's ID by turning on Developer Mode in the Appearance menu of Discord settings. This seems to be the only thing Developer Mode does.

Use `!pinfile` to grab the current channel's pin file, or `!pinfile #channel` to obtain another channel's pin file.

Use `!invite` to obtain an invite for Scribe, or use this link: https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=413082884912578560&permissions=0&scope=bot
